# Aiding Speech Therapy using Audio Video Processing
Speech disorders are growing increasingly common but its treatment and diagnosis is still not easily available to most people. There are different therapies for varying types of speech defects. These are all based on face to face interactions between the patient and the pathologist. Due to various reasons like cost or commuting time there exists accessibility issues to these treatments.  Technological developments in the fields of audio and video processing can be used to rectify the problem of accessibility of treatment. Leveraging technology can be a viable alternative to the conventional approach of treatment of speech defects.
<br />After reviewing several papers and different methodologies that are currently being used to help in the treatment, we seek to devise a system that can help aid speech therapy. The goal is to digitalize and automate part of the therapy in order to make it more readily available to the general public, hence raising awareness of this growing concern and increasing accessibility of treatment. The proposed system utilizes concepts of video and audio processing and aims to aid the patientâ€™s recovery in an economical and convenient manner.
